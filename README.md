Term project: Radial basis function Network

In this exercise, you need to implement your version of radial basis function
network with xed centers to classify the breast cancer data set. You should
rst divide your data set into training sets and test set appropriately, and then
rst train the RBF network and then report your classication accuraries on
training data, and test data. You also need to report the confusion matrix of
the classier. Also, please choose the centers of RBF randomly from the data.
To compare the performance, please use dierent number of centers, and then
report the best t to this data. The detailed explanation of RBF network can
be found in [4]. The width of the RBF kernel should also be determined using
cross validation.
